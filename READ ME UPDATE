# UGV Mesh Network Simulator

This project simulates a swarm of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) that maintain a self-healing mesh network while following a mission route with predefined checkpoints.

## ✅ Key Features

- 📍 Checkpoint-based navigation
- 📡 Dynamic radio mesh construction using signal strength
- 🔁 Auto-repair & reconnection logic
- ⛽ Fuel timers and RTB (return to base)
- 🛡️ IFF tamper detection failsafe
- 📉 Mission abort logic based on signal KPIs

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python 3
- networkx
- matplotlib
- Google Colab compatible

## 📂 Usage

Open the notebook in Google Colab or JupyterLab and run each cell. Use the simulated battlefield loop to see UGVs adapt to network failures and mission constraints.
